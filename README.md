# Etch-A-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch is a poplar children's toy in which children use two circular knobs to draw a picture on the toy screen. The digital version involved four sensors, where each one represented either left, right, up or down and the screen was displayed on a monitor. 

The project uses 4 QRD1114 Reflective Object sensors connected to an Arduino UNO. The input from the sensors was passed from the Arduino to an Altera DE1-SoC board through GPIO Pins. The digital toy was shown on a monitor through VGA for the player to draw using the sensors. The project was coded in Arduino scripts, and Verilog. 

The project was coded by Nurin Fazil and Idilo Abdalla. November 2018.
